This is what I hope will become an rpg voxel game based on my own ideas and creations. I need help though, seeing as I am 18 and inspired, I lack all of the skills required to use Unity3D to create my rendering and game mapping. If you want to help me out and possibly teach me, I would appreciate it greatly. Of course I do know how to create voxels and animate them, creating the game environment is the only skill I lack.
